Hi, I’m **Heesung Yun**, an Information Security professional based in New York.  
Currently, I work as Assistant Vice President at Shinhan Bank America, where I lead strategic security initiatives including IAM, SSO integration, SIEM optimization, and regulatory audits.

My expertise lies in connecting security frameworks with real business goals —  
delivering measurable improvements in risk reduction, operational efficiency, and user experience.

I believe that **strong security is the foundation of trust**, and I strive to implement systems that not only protect organizations but also support seamless and intuitive workflows.

> My long-term goal is to become a strategic security leader who bridges technical rigor and human-centered design — shaping a safer, smarter, and more user-aligned digital environment.
