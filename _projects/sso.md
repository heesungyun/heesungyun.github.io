## Situation

The organization relied on multiple disjointed login systems across internal tools, vendor platforms, and cloud services.  
This caused significant friction in user access and introduced potential security gaps.

## Task

As the lead engineer on the project, I was responsible for designing and implementing a unified SSO solution to simplify authentication across the enterprise â€” without compromising compliance or performance.

## Action

- Selected OKTA as the enterprise-wide SSO provider after conducting a vendor evaluation
- Designed a phased integration plan across HRIS, email, internal admin portals, and customer-facing platforms
- Led the integration work with IT and engineering teams while managing employee communication and training
- Aligned implementation with internal compliance audits and vendor-specific access control standards

## Result

- Successfully integrated SSO across **100%** of core business systems within 3 months
- Reduced password reset-related IT tickets by over **50%**
- Increased audit readiness and visibility into user access, resulting in improved compliance posture
