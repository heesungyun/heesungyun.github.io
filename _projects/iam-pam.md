## Situation

The organization lacked a centralized identity and privileged access system.  
There were fragmented authentication flows across departments, posing operational inefficiencies and security risks.

## Task

I was appointed as the project lead to design, implement, and integrate a full-scale enterprise IAM and PAM solution â€” including defining governance policies, workflows, and alignment with auditors and technical teams.

## Action

- Conducted a needs analysis and selected OKTA-based solution for both identity and privileged access control.
- Led stakeholder alignment across IT, InfoSec, HR, and external consultants.
- Designed custom access workflows and implemented phased onboarding by department.
- Delivered internal training, change management, and audit-aligned documentation.

## Result

- Achieved seamless identity and privileged access integration across all major systems.
- Reduced access provisioning time by **40%**, and improved access policy compliance score by **25%** in audits.
- Presented results to board-level stakeholders, contributing to org-wide policy updates.
